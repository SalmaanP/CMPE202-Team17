XP core value : Respect
Out of the XP core values, I have selected “Respect” and I will make sure this value is thorougly followed during the entire project lifecycle.

Last week we had finalized that we would create a game in GreenFoot that would help kids learn how sorting algorithms work in computer.
This week we started developing our "Greenfoot world" that would basically contain all the entities/actors involved in the game.
We had our weekly meeting to decide how to approach designing and development of the game. I made sure each of the members contributed to the discussion.
We noted down important points and action items and converted those action items into waffle board tasks.Each member was asked whats their opinion on discussion regarding the greenfoot world design. Made sure none of the team member felt ignored or unappreciated.
Each member was assigned tasks created on waffle board after meeting.Members were allowed to pick up tasks that interested them.Each team mate was aware about what other team mates were working on.
Next week we plan to move ahead in the developing important use cases.During our weekly meeting we will discuss on important use cases and behavious to be assigned to respective actors in greenfoot game. Will work towards dividing the gameplay into different modules and work towards their completion.
