## XP Value -  See the Whole

> This week we have started with the basic development of the sorting game that we are going to implement. 

* As per my xp value I took care that whatever process that is followed, everyone knows about the project as a whole.
* While starting with development we have divided the whole project into multple modules , thus making it easier to analyze our situation and progress at any given point.
* The modules are then divided amongst all the team members and they would be responsible for completion of that particular module. This process was choosen so that each of the member feels responsible and also it makes finding errors easier.
* So to conclude the overall situation of the project seems pretty good and also now the actual development is in progress.
