#Simplicity

* This week, we started to develop the game as per our analysis in the previous weeks. We decided to start with the 
game world and prepare use cases and do developement in that way. We distributed different tasks among ourselves 
as well, keeping in mind that everyone gets a fair amount of work involved.

* We had a discussion while preparing the game world about how much information should be presented to the users. 
We had options to display a lot of information to the user at all times, or keep the space clear and show only what is required. 
We finally decided to keep the user interface simple and minimalistic as kids will be able to understand the game better 
and it will also keep the focus on the game mechanics.
 
 * We kept the development fairly simple, to allow one person to be aware of what the other person was completing. It also 
 kept the entire team aware of where our progress is and how much remains. We assigned the tasks on waffle board for 
 the team members as well, so everyone knew what was assigned to whom.
 
 * Next week, we will take the development ahead and build some of the use cases that we have prepared for the game.
