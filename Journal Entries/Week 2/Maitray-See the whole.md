# See the Whole

> I have choosen the XP value which is "SEE THE WHOLE". 
> It is such an important value because if it isn't there then the project would never get to the level as initially imagined.

- For the second week I was happy to see the team coming together with everyone pitching in their ideas while intently listening to the ideas that other team members had.
- This week we also saw us communicating and interacting each other more often about different topics.
- This week each of the team members came up with the games that they would like to implement and build a project on top of them , I was happy to see that everyone was building on top of each others ideas.
- We started with having weekly team meetings where the issues were discusses extensively. Team meetings adds a lot of benefit to the team as team gets to know each other better as well as some things are better discussed in person.
- And last but not least I am really happy to see that all the team members are able to align on a common goal and everyone is working towards that common goal.
