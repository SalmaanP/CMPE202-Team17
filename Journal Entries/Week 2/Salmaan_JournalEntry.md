#Simplicity

* This week was pretty lively as the entire team got together to consolidate everyone's research and bounce idea's 
around to get a discussion going.

* We had several important decisions to make and there was tons of research with everyone, so it was quite a task 
to make sure we kept the decision making process simple to minimize time invested and maximize productivity.

* For every topic we compared the collected research and debated the pros and cons of a specfic process. By keeping 
a streamlined process we were able to make some concrete headway which will help us in the coming weeks.

* There is one specific instance which I can recall from this week where incorporating simplicity helped us make a decision. 
We were discussing game development platforms and we were in a fix between choosing Unity or Greenfoot and I suggested 
that since Greenfoot uses Java, it will be simpler to manage design patterns and will also allow us to learn more as it is more 
primitive compared to Unity. The team was receptive to the suggestion and we were able to make a decision on using Greenfoot 
as our platform.

* The next week also presents a challenge as we go out to understanding the requirements for the shortlisted games and 
getting started with it, but the team is getting into the groove and is prepared for it.
