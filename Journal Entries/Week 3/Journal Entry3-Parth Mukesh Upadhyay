XP core value : Respect
Out of the XP core values, I have selected “Respect” and I will make sure this value is thorougly followed during the entire project lifecycle.

Last week we had finalized some cs unplugged activities that could be modelled into a game. This week we had a group meeting to discuss upon these
selected activities on length. After thorough discussion and analysis we finalized on creating a game that would teach different sorting
algorithms.

Took opinion of each team member on different cs unplugged activities finalized before selecting Sorting Algorithms. Asked each team member which
activity according to them is better and why. Made sure that the discussions done for finalizing the activity involved each team member and in no
way any of them felt ignored or unappreciated.

During the meeting we also discussed on creating concept arts for the game which would help us understand how to model the game flow. After the
meeting each team member was given an action item , which was to create a concept art.Each team member's opinions, suggestions and ideas were
valued and they were given chance to pick up tasks that interested them.
