**XP Value - SEE THE WHOLE**

This week we as a team took some major decisions. We have decided on the game that we would be implementing in greenfoot. The game we picked up is based on Sorting Algorithms - specifically the bubble sort. 

We thought that this topic would be a good topic to choose because in a real world there are many scenarios where the user would encounter this problem and a computer is Jo different. So this would help the user to understand the use of sorting Algorithms pretty quickly. 

The other important thing we worked on was the concept art of the game. It was very important for us as a team to have a visual representation of what would the game look like. The design that we have implemented for now is no way perfect but it gives us a starting point. Also , we would keep on integrating over the design taking inputs from the whole team .

My XP value is "see the whole", so to encapsulate the project as a whole , I can say with confidence that we are moving in the right direction. The team is also bonding well with each of them bouncing ideas on one another and building on top of that. As a project we have laid out a game definition for us and also come up with the basic visuals of the game to help everyone know what they are working for. This gives me the confidence that we are moving in the right direction and also at a pace with which everyone is comfortable.
