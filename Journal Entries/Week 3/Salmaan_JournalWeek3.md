#Simplicity

* This week saw some major decisions on which the foundation of the game will be laid on. We shortlisted some topics 
for the game, and finally settled on creating a game which could teach students one or more of the sorting algorithms and how a computer
uses it to sort items.

* Simplicity was a major factor in deciding the game. The target audience for the game required the game to be intuitive and 
easy to use as well as navigate. We also felt that sorting was an activity with which young students will already have some
 experience with in the real world. So instead of understanding a totally new abstract concept, sorting will provide them 
 a new perspective on how a machine does the same task which they do.
 
 * We also prepared a few concept arts of the various screens in the game which will help us while development to make 
 sure the game is being developed in the right direction. We made a conscious decision to make the design minimalistic, 
 as it will help to keep the focus on the sorting as it happens. This is also how we will be incorporating simplicity xp 
 value in our project.
 
 * Next week, we look forward to planning different use cases and the structuring flow of the game, as well start some 
 coding on one of the use cases.
