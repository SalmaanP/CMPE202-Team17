Journal Entry 5 on Feedback

•	This week we started developing the functionalities of the game. We divided the screens of the game amongst the team members and started coding on it.

•	I made sure that every team member’s feedback is taken regularly and acted accordingly.

•	We chose individual tasks based on our interests so that we can develop the game quickly.

•	We planned the work in such a way so that we can have the benefits of peer programming to reduce the feedback loop.

•	By doing this, the work was done relatively faster and process of giving feedback was quick.

•	We also decided to change some implementations based on the discussions in the meeting as the code could be optimized.

•	Also we started learning the design patterns so that we can use them in our game.

•	We will take feedback from all the team members in this week about the implementation of the design patterns in our game.
