# Simplicity

* This week was full of development, and the entire team was busy with their assigned tasks. We divided the tasks in small modules which could then be integrated
as soon as some significant amount of work was done on it.

* The first task was to define how we were going to change the state of the game with each screen. There were many ideas, but some were quite unecessarily complex
than the other. In the end we decided to go with implementing a state pattern with each screen as a state for the game. This made the design of the game simple, as well
as the development much more organized.

* The rest of the week was focused on developing the individual screens, and each member was assigned some tasks. We also worked out a logic for the main game screen
and the main idea behind it was to keep it simple, not only for development but also while playing so that the user can cleary understand what was going on, in this case
kids as the game is specially targeted towards them.

* Next week we hope to have a good chunk of work done to get a working game logic and then hope to refine it better.
