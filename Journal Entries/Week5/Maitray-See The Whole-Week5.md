# XP Value - See The Whole #

>This week was particularly exciting as we finally got started with the development of the project and it was amazing to see the game coming to life.

The xp value "see the whole" focussed me to look at the whole picture of how the game would look like, what kind of charachter are we trying to potray. Is the game delivering the topic we are trying to explain easily or not. Is the game interesting to play. Is the game implementing the things that are expected of us.

With all these questions in mind we started with development. In the initial weeks we had decided upon the basic gameplay , now it was time to implement it. We divided the screens amongst all the team members so that the workload is divided equally. After that we had a meeting where we discussed the coding style and how the different design patterns can be implemented in such a way that the code would be easy to maintain and easy to integrate. I proposed a plan under which the inital plan for the game is to build it as simple as possible and focus more on the functionalities and the code itself. Under the second interation we will iron out all the other irregularities based on the inputs we get from different people. Under the third iteration with all the functionalities locked in we will work on improving the gameplay to make it truly interactive and enjoyable.
