#XP core value : Respect#
>Out of the XP core values, I have selected “Respect” and I will make sure this value is thorougly followed during the entire project lifecycle.

With this week we started Part2 of our CMPE202 team project.Uptill now we were focussed on requirement analysis and designing or our game based on CS unplugged activity.

This week we started developing important modules and divided work among team members equally.We focussed on developing the flow of the game, thereby deciding different important screens to be used within game.
Each team member was assigned a screen to develop. 

During weekly team meeting we worked towards proper division of work among team mates and how to implement state pattern for handling screens within game.I made sure each team member was involved within the discussion and none of team member felt neglected or disrespected in any way.

The most important screen of all screens is the main screen and we had a healthy discussion over its design and functionality. We created start state of the main screen and next week plan to work towards the game logic .
