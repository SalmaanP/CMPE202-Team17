# Simplicity

* This week, we worked on developing the main sorting logic of the game. With this part being completed we now have the basic game with all screens 
completed. This will now allow us to focus better on the multiplayer aspect of the game, and also polish the game further.

* We also implemented a timer which introduces a competitive aspect to the game. We plan to keep the game competitive while also keeping it 
simple to learn and play, and so far we have been successful in our efforts. For now our plan is to make players vying for the top spot using the timer.

* We also started work on a simple server built using node.js to test our strategy. For now we implemented a simple call from the game to the server. In the coming week, 
we will implement much more with the server to make the multiplayer.

* With the currently implemented state pattern, we have identified places where design patterns will be highly useful and 
our plan for the next week is to also implement design patterns in the code, and also refactor the existing code to optimize it further.
