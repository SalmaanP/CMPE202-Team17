#XP VALUE - See the Whole

> This week was a very important week for us as we finally integrated bulk our game together and we had a fun experience playing the game.

The main goal for this week was to ensure that everything worked smoothly after integrating. We have added multiplayer mode where the users can play against each other which makes the game all the more fun. We ensured that all of our focus was to make a really fun game and not just some boring game to teach the concept. We decided to go through the Lobby implementation for implementing the multiplayer mode. We uploaded our API's on AWS to ensure its availability.

From next week we would go on to test the game and the API's more thoroughly to find any remaining bugs in the game and refine the game a little more to make it a really fun and interactive game.
