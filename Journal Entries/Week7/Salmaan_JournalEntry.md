#Simplicity


* This week was completely focused on creating an immersive and competitive multiplayer aspect for the game.The team bounced around lots of ideas and aspects 
for the game. In the end we decided to not add a layer of complexity for the game but instead complement the already exisiting game mechanics to create a better 
experience for the player.

* We decided to add a scoring system and also implement a lobby system where two players can play simultaneously. This gives a very competeitive edge to the 
game and makes the game incredibly fun to play with especially with friends around. The game is able to work through API's built using node.js.

* We also made the game available on cloud, which makes the game ready to play for the anyone around the world. Overall, this has been a very satisfying week 
and we made lot of progess in quite a short amount of time. All team members approach to the game was unified and everyone was on the same page with 
how the game should be played.

* Then next week will be focused more on testing the game from the ground up and making sure there are no bugs.
