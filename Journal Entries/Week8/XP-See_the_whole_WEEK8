#XP Value - See the whole

> This was the last week of the sprint cycle. When we look back at all the weeks, we have come a long way from making a design on paper to converting that into an actual game. 

This week we tested our game in front of actual students of "Lowell Elementary School". It was a really fun exercise that we carried out to expose kids to the world of computer sciemce. The kids were mostly fourth and fifth graders. The group also comprised of volunteers from different domains such as Child Development, Politics etc so it made a really diverse group.

All of them interact with computers in their daily life. So our task was to actually make them think that the tasks that are considered simple by us humans are how solved by the computers.

We explained how the Bubble Sort works by physically demonstrating an activity after that we let the kids play the game against each other as it was a multiplayer game. This exercise helped us in getting the insights that we wanted that is how was the game able to handle multiple lobbies, how the kids reacted to the user interface of the game, was the game actually fun to play, was the game able to convey the message that we wanted to convey. We got answers to all the above questions and whatever information we got will be used to slightly refine and tweak the game.

All in all this whole team project taught us a lot of lessons as we wanted to make a game that was actually fun to play and not just teach some algorithm.

And about my XP value - See the whole. I understood the importance of having a plan for the whole project. It made things easier for us and we weren't stuck thinking what to do next. After each week we had a plan ready for the next week's task. This added transperancy to the team as well. And if anything broke it made it really easy for us to figure it out and fix that.

I think that all the XP values picked up by the other team members also played a huge role in making this project a real joy.
