#XP core value : Respect#
>Out of the XP core values, I have selected “Respect” and I will make sure this value is thoroughly followed during the entire project lifecycle.

This was our final week for CMPE202 team project. During this week we tested our application/game thoroughly 
to find any bugs and make it robust.

We gave a demo of our game to 4th graders of Lowell Elementary School and also explained them how sorting works
in computers by playing out a CS Unplugged activity with them.Finally we made the game available to the kids 
and let them play against each other using our multiplayer mode.

During the weekly team meeting we discussed about testing our application end to end before actual demo to the kids.
Each team member was assigned a module to test and raise a issue in waffle board if any issue is found.During our 
testing of game we found few issues which were fixed before the demo.

We worked over improvement of our multiplayer mode.Added a new lobby screen to handle waiting user till a new user joins.
LeaderBoard displays the winner among to multiplayer users and also shows the rank.

Finally after working over all these week over this game realized importance of different XP values used by each team mate.
Respect plays a very important role in a team work.
