#Simplicity


* This week marked the final week of the sprint. Looking back at the last 7 weeks, the team feels we came a long way starting from designing the structure of the game 
to having a fully functional working model of the game. We also had a demo of the game with the actual audience it was intended for - children.

* Our team made it to Lowell Elementary School for a session to teach 4th graders what sorting is all about in computers, how bubble sort works and translates
 into the real world, and finally have some fun while playing our game. It felt incredibly satisfying to watch the kids have fun while playing the game which we all worked on for the past 7 weeks. The kids learning about the basics of sorting 
was the cherry on top and it broke our own expectations of how the kids would receive the game.

* The days before the presentation were more focused on testing the game from start to end to make sure there are no unforeseen consequences while the kids were playing the 
game. Our approach was simple, and it worked. Start the game and do everything a user wasn't supposed to be doing. This gave us a good idea of some unintended
 behavior that could happen while a game was in progress.
 
* The main task was to make sure the multiplayer lobbies and sessions were kept in sync and no lobby was lost. We did encounter a situation where if a game was reset 
after starting a lobby, the other player was left in a limbo, but we were quick to fix it. Again our simple approach made it easy to spot these bugs.

* Coming at the end of this sprint, the team does feel it has learnt a lot and made a great deal of progress and ended up with an actual game to show for. The systematic 
development approach definitely helped and make sure the project was developed on time and with proper distribution of work within the team. The XP values for the project 
was also important to maintain a healthy team environment.
