#Simplicity

For this project my focus within the team will be on keeping things simple.

* For our project, our topic should be one out of csunplugged topics to teach basic CS topics. I feel that this XP value will be of tremendous use throughout the project.
 As the project itself requires teaching advanced topics in a simple manner to people with zero potential knowledge about the subject, keeping a simple idea will help us at every stage.
 
 * For the first week, we decided on several key factors which will directly impact our project status. Things like commit methods, communication models, type of platform etc, all these
things were decided. I made an effort to make sure that none of these get in the way of actual work of the project. Many tools have a steep learning curve which itself takes a long time 
to learn, however since we ourself are short on time, the team decided to take simpler methods like slack, and branch and pull to commit.

* We get started with development and research next week, and for sure simplicity will remain a top priority in making key decisions.
