** See the Whole**

For this team project my focus would be to see the whole picture.

The world of software is often mired with complexities and thus it becomes very important that we see the bigger picture. So as I pick up this responsibility, my job would then to be ensure that all of the team members know about the project as a whole i.e where we are and what we want to achieve at the end of this project. 

I personally believe that when everyone knows about the bigger picture, 
they can work much better to realise that goal and this also helps in  adding transperancy.    

* For the first week, we had a discussion on many important factors that could ultimaltely impact out final goal. We set out to put some structure in place such as deciding on the communication method, commit methods and hearing everyones opinions.

* Secondly , we made sure that everyone is comfortable working with each other and all of us are working towards a common goal. 

And after deciding on all this, we will start with the topic to be deicided for the final project and aslo getting used to the development environment.
