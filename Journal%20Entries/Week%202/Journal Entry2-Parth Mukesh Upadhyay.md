XP core value : Respect
Out of the XP core values, I have selected “Respect” and I will make sure this value is thorougly followed during the entire project lifecycle.

First week involved research on different cs unplugged activities which can be modelled into a interactive game.
Each team member looked into it and did research on different activities.
We also looked into different platforms on which game can be created and finalized greenfoot.
After research phase we had a team meeting to finalize a activity which could be modelled into a game on greenFoot.
I made sure each team member's research on cs unplugged activity was covered during team meeting and all research tasks were equally distributed among team members.
Each team member's opinions, suggestions and ideas were valued and they were given chance to pick up tasks that interested them.
Each team member was given chance to explain their cs unplugged activity and what they think of other ideas.
Made sure none of the team members felt neglected, unvalued or disrespected in any form
Asked each team member to personally reach out to me if they felt unappreciated or neglected , so that things can be improved during next week.
