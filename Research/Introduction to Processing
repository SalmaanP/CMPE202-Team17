Introduction to Processing

For the team project we started exploring Processing as well along with Greenfoot.
I learnt more about processing through the task of Lab1 that was to implement Gumball Machine.

I started with the code that was provided. 
For further learning I started to explore the tutorials provided on the processing website.
https://processing.org/tutorials/

Also from the starter code provided I understood about state pattern implemented in the code.

The processing forum was also quite helpful in solving my queries.
