Introduction to Greenfoot

Greenfoot is an interactive java development environment used to design 2D games and graphics.
I learnt more about the greenfoot through Lab1 in which we had to design a gumball machine. For starting with it I referred 
to the basic code structure provided.

After I understood the structure I referred to the API documentation provided by Greenfoot.

Also the youtube channel of greenfoot was also quite helpful for learning.

And for all the other doubts I used the discussion forum of greenfoot.
