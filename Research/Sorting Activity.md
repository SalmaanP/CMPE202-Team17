# Game for sorting problems.

* Sorting is a popular problem in computer science and it has its relevance in the real world as well. By finding out how a computer manages to solve this problem
and the different types of techniques with which it can be implemented would be very educational for students who have little background in computer science.

* We can propose a game which goes through the motions of sorting by picking one or more techinique and demonstrating how a computer would go though it. 
 The activity can be gamefied by adding some constraints and a scoring pattern with a leaderboard for further interest by the students.
 
 * The users can be given several hints along the way to make sure the game is educational for them in the end. The game could also give the users limited number of chances to sort 
 the objects themselves, where they can reveal the objects actual position among the different objects present.
