Topic and Game for the Team Project

CS TOPIC THEORY - BINARY SEARCH
The topic that I picked up for the team project was Binary Searching.
In binary search the basic concept is that if you want to find a number from a list of sorted numbers ,
you start with the middle element and check if it is bigger than the number to be searched then you move towards the elements 
that are smaller than those i.e towards first element and ignore everything after middle element. If the middle element is 
smaller then you start moving towards the bigger numbers i.e last element and ignore all the elements before middle element.
You continue to do this recursively until you find the element.

GAME FROM CS UNPLUGGED
In the game the user will start from "Level 1" in which he will be given 16 cups and all the cups contain a ball with 
a number under it.
You need to find the number but will be given only 8 tries.

As you move towards "Level 2" you will be given only 6 tries to find the number.

In "Level 3" the player would get only 4 tries which are maximum tries required to find a number through binary search technique.
In this level the player is supposed to find the middle element and subsequently move ahead.
